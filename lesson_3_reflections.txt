Whem would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I'm working from different places, or if a group of people is involved in working
	on the project, it is good idea to have a common remote repository to keep all of
	the work at one place that is available for everyone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Obviously, you might be currently working on an improvement or a bug fix for your
	program. This work will probably take an undefined amount of time and could stretch
	for days. If in the middle your Git will update its state, all your changes will be
	lost. And you don't want that to happen. So the pull must always be manual (as well
	as the push, for similar reasons).
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

	Forks are clones made on GitHub exclusively. They are a copy of someone else's
	repository on GitHub to your profile's repository. You should use it if you want
	to use someone else's project as a basis for your own, for example. Clones are
	copies of repositories on your computer - both local copies and copies from GitHub.
	You should use them to store data on your computer for better working environment
	and offline availability. Branches are parts of the same repository which provide
	the option to work on different versions simultaneously or try out experimental
	features. You should use them if you want to keep a certain state of your work
	intact while working on something additional for the same project at the same time.
