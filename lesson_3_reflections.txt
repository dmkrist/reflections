Whem would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I'm working from different places, or if a group of people is involved in working
	on the project, it is good idea to have a common remote repository to keep all of
	the work at one place that is available for everyone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Obviously, you might be currently working on an improvement or a bug fix for your
	program. This work will probably take an undefined amount of time and could stretch
	for days. If in the middle your Git will update its state, all your changes will be
	lost. And you don't want that to happen. So the pull must always be manual (as well
	as the push, for similar reasons).
