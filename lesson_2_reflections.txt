What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When initializing a repository, Git creates a folder '.git' where it will be
	storing the version history of the repository. It does not, however, create
	a first commit.
	You need to make this initialization in order to prepare Git for recording
	the files history. Otherwise there will be just current versions of the files.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a virtual part of git (unlike the physical directory or repository)
	which allows you to temporarily	store files that you are going to commit. It makes
	it possible to make a list of different files, and to make a commit that is logically
	complete at once.
